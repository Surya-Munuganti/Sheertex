Hi,

I have completed the desktop version using Next.js and Tailwind css. I didn't add responsiveness to the design. I was not familiar with Next.js and tailwind so it took me around 4h to do this version. 
If you insist I will try adding responsiveness. I usually use bootstrap for that purpose. Let me know if you like my work. I really enjoyed working on this assignment.


Thank you for you consideration.
